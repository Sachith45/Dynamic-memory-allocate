# Dynamic-memory-allocate
Implement a malloc-like memory allocation library in C.<br>

1. Declare a global array of 25000 bytes.<br>

2. You must implement a function that is like malloc(). Call it MyMalloc(). Its signature is similar to malloc(). You should also implement MyFree() which has a signature and functionality that are similar to free(). Read the documentation on malloc() and free(). It would be a good idea to use malloc and free before attempting to implement MyMalloc() and MyFree().<br>

3. MyMalloc() allocates memory only from the previously mentioned array of 25000 bytes.<br>

4. All the data structures that are required to manage the memory must also reside within the same array.<br>

5. MyMalloc() and MyFree() must be in a file called mymalloc.c. You should also provide a suitable header file mymalloc.h.<br>

6. Our test program contains the main() and it includes mymalloc.h. Do not include a main() in your mymalloc.c.<br>

7. Upload only the mymalloc.c and mymalloc.h to UGVLE by the due date.<br>

8. You cannot use malloc() and free() in your implementation of MyMalloc() and MyFree().<br>
